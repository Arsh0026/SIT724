Step, Description
1, Initialize quantum registers and classical registers
2, Initialize cluster centroids randomly or using a deterministic method
3, Encode classical data points into quantum states
4, Set maximum number of iterations and convergence threshold
5, Repeat until convergence or maximum iterations reached
6, Assign each data point to the nearest cluster centroid
7, Update cluster centroids
8, Check for convergence
9, Extract final cluster centroids from quantum registers
10, Decode quantum cluster centroids to obtain classical representations
11, Evaluate clustering quality using metrics such as within-cluster sum of squares
12, Output the final cluster centroids and evaluation results
