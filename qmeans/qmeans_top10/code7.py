"""
Contribute quantum and classical registers.	Use a deterministic method to set up cluster centroids.	Classical data points should be converted to quantum states.	The maximum number of iterations and convergence threshold can be set.	Continue until either convergence or the maximum iteration is reached.	Each data point should be assigned to the nearest cluster centroid.	Update centroids.	Final cluster centroids can be found in the quantum register.	Use metrics such as within-cluster sum of squares to evaluate clustering quality.	Classical representations can be obtained by coding quantum cluster centroids.	Using metrics such as within-cluster sum of squares, evaluate clustering quality.	The final cluster centroids and evaluation results need to be output.
