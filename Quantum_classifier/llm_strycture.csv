"Setting and Description"
"Optimization Settings: Generate code to add a learning rate scheduler to the optimizer in the Quantum Hybrid Neural Network to improve training efficiency."
"Enhanced GPU Utilization: Write a function that ensures the HybridNet model and all tensors are moved to GPU if available, optimizing memory and computation speed."
"Data Augmentation: Provide code to implement data augmentation in the DatasetHandler class for the training dataset to enhance model generalizability."
"Error Handling in Dataset Loading: Create error handling in the DatasetHandler class for scenarios where data paths or labels cannot be correctly loaded or parsed."
"Quantum Circuit Parameter Tuning: Suggest code modifications to allow dynamic adjustment of quantum circuit parameters such as the number of qubits and layers based on dataset features."
"Real-time Training Metrics: Generate code for real-time visualization of training loss and validation accuracy during each epoch using matplotlib or another plotting library."
"Checkpoint Enhancements: Improve the checkpoint saving mechanism to include more state information, such as the validation loss and the learning rate, and generate code for automatic recovery from the last best state after a failure."
"Advanced Model Evaluation: Write code to perform more comprehensive model evaluations after training, including precision-recall curves and ROC curves for each class."
"Quantum Layer Expansion: Propose a method to integrate additional quantum layers into the HybridNet model, and generate corresponding PyTorch-compatible quantum circuit code."
