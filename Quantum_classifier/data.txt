Adding a learning rate scheduler to the optimizer in the quantum hybrid neural network will improve training efficiency.
"If available, write a function that will ensure the hybridNet model and all the tensors are moved to the graphics card."
Code to implement data augmentation in the DatasetHandler class for the training dataset to enhance model generalizability
"If data paths or labels can't be correctly loaded or parsed, you can create error handling in the DatasetHandler class."
"Suggest code modifications to allow for dynamic adjustment of quantum circuit parameters, such as the number of qubits and layers, based on dataset features."
Generate code for real-time visualization of training loss and validation accuracy using matplotlib or another plot library.
"Improve the checkpoint saving mechanism to include more state information, such as the validation loss and learning rate, and generate code for automatic recovery from the last best state after a failure"
""
Propose a method to integrate additional quantum layers into the hybrid net model and generate corresponding pytorch compatible quantum circuit code.
